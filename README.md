# Introduction to Version Control Systems

## What is a VCS?
Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.

## Types of Version Control Systems: 

* Local Version Control Systems
* Centralized Version Control Systems
* Distributed Version Control Systems

## Centralized Version Control Systems:
Here ,there’s a central repo shared with all the developers, and everyone gets their own working copy. Whenever you commit, the changes get reflected directly in the repo. Unlike distributed systems, developers directly commit to the remote. Which means they may affect files knowingly or unknowingly.

## What is DVCS?
A distributed version control system (DVCS) brings a local copy of the complete repository to every team member’s computer, so they can commit, branch, and merge locally. The server doesn’t have to store a physical file for each branch — it just needs the differences between each commit.

## Advantages of DVCS
In the Centralized VCS, every commit was directly happening to the, say, remote repo. But in distributed VCS, it first happens in the developer's local repo, and then they send those changes to the remote.

## Various VCS
* Git
* Mercurial
* Perforce
